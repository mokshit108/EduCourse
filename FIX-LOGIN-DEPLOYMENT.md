# Fix Login Issue - Deployment Guide

## Problem
The deployed application shows "Invalid email or password" error because the production database hasn't been seeded with demo users.

## Solution
I've created a comprehensive fix that includes:

1. **Migration with Seed Data**: Created a migration that includes demo users
2. **Production Seeding Script**: Added a dedicated script for production seeding
3. **Updated Deployment Process**: Modified render.yaml to automatically seed the database

## Files Modified

### 1. Backend Environment (`.env`)
- Updated with production PostgreSQL database URL
- Set proper BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12 for production
- Configured CORS for your frontend URL

### 2. Migration Script (`prisma/migrations/20250810120233_seed_demo_users/migration.sql`)
- Creates tables if they don't exist
- Seeds demo users with properly hashed passwords
- Seeds demo courses and enrollments
- Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to prevent duplicates

### 3. Production Seeding Script (`seed-production.js`)
- Standalone script for seeding production database
- Uses the correct bcrypt hash for 'password123'
- Can be run manually if needed

### 4. Updated Deployment (`render.yaml`)
- Added `npx prisma migrate deploy` to build command
- Added `npm run db:seed-production` to automatically seed after migration

### 5. Package.json
- Added `db:seed-production` script for manual seeding

## Demo Users Available After Fix

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| john@example.com | password123 | Student |
| jane@example.com | password123 | Student |
| prof@example.com | password123 | Professor |

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)
1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. Render will automatically redeploy
3. The build process will run migrations and seed the database
4. Login should work immediately after deployment

### Option 2: Manual Seeding (If needed)
If automatic seeding fails, you can manually seed the database:

1. Go to your Render backend service dashboard
2. Open the "Shell" tab
3. Run: `npm run db:seed-production`

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Deployment Logs**: Look for "✅ Production database seeded successfully!" in the build logs
2. **Test Login**: Try logging in with any of the demo accounts
3. **Check Database**: Verify users exist in your PostgreSQL database

## Troubleshooting

### If Login Still Fails:
1. Check Render build logs for seeding errors
2. Verify DATABASE_URL is correct in environment variables
3. Run manual seeding command in Render shell
4. Check if JWT_SECRET is properly set

### If Build Fails:
1. Check that all environment variables are set in Render
2. Verify PostgreSQL database is running and accessible
3. Check migration logs for SQL errors

## Security Notes

- The JWT_SECRET in your .env should be changed to a secure random string
- Demo users are for testing only - remove or change passwords in production
- Database credentials are properly secured in Render environment variables

## Next Steps

1. Deploy these changes
2. Test login functionality
3. Consider adding user registration functionality
4. Update demo credentials or remove them for production use

---

**Status**: Ready for deployment ✅
**Expected Result**: Login functionality will work with demo accounts
**Rollback**: If issues occur, you can remove the seeding from render.yaml build command
